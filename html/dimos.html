        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The Kitchen Display System and Digital Menu project aims to
          revolutionize the order management process in small restaurants. By
          developing a user-friendly interface and incorporating real-time
          updates, the system seeks to replace traditional paper tickets,
          eliminate human errors, and provide data insights for efficient
          decision-making. This case study presents the project's approach, the
          achieved results, and the overall conclusion.
        </p>

        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>
          To create the Kitchen Display System and Digital Menu, a monolithic
          architecture was adopted to ensure simplicity in development and
          deployment. The system's frontend was built using HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript, with EJS as the templating engine for dynamic content.
        </p>

          <img src="/assets/images/dimos/system-architecture.webp" alt="DiMOS - System Architecture" />


        </div>

        <p>
          On the backend, Node.js and Express.js were chosen to develop a
          scalable and efficient web application. Role-based access control was
          implemented to manage user roles, granting specific permissions based
          on the tasks they needed to perform. The integration of Socket.io
          facilitated real-time communication, enabling order status updates for
          both customers and kitchen staff.
        </p>

        <p>
          The project relied on MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-based database, to store
          data efficiently. Passwords were encrypted using Bcrypt.js to enhance
          data security.
        </p>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
          The Kitchen Display System and Digital Menu successfully met its
          objectives. Customers can now browse the digital menu, select their
          desired meals, and place orders with ease. The menu management feature
          allows kitchen staff to efficiently add, edit, or delete dishes.
          Real-time updates on order status have significantly improved the
          order management process. Additionally, the data insights dashboard
          provides valuable information on popular items, sales trends, and
          customer preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          User feedback during the first release was instrumental in making
          several improvements to the application. Merging the menu and cart
          pages, resolving issues with order details links, and enhancing button
          sizes in the kitchen staff's view improved usability.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          The Kitchen Display System and Digital Menu have revolutionized the
          order management process for small restaurants. By providing an
          affordable and efficient alternative to traditional systems, the
          project empowers restaurant owners to digitalize their businesses and
          increase accuracy, speed, and customer satisfaction. The seamless
          integration of user-friendly interfaces, real-time updates, and data
          insights make this system an invaluable asset for small restaurant
          businesses looking to enhance their operations. With continued
          improvements and scalability considerations, the project holds the
          potential to transform the restaurant industry and modernize the
          dining experience.
