        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The Digital Menu Ordering System project aims to revolutionize the
          order management process in small restaurants. By developing a
          user-friendly interface and incorporating real-time updates, the
          system seeks to replace traditional paper tickets, eliminate human
          errors, and provide data insights for efficient decision-making. This
          case study presents the project's approach, the achieved results, and
          the overall conclusion.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Background</h3>
        <p>
          Restaurants nowadays, especially in large and busy metropolitan areas,
          need to serve food to large number of people in short time frame,
          leaving the customer satisfied not only with the quality of the food
          but also for the quality of the service.
        </p>
        <p>
          For small businesses is essential to save costs maintaining the same
          service quality otherwise they cannot survive or compete with large
          restaurants chains. The aim is to create an affordable application
          that can enhance the competitiveness of restaurant owners while
          minimizing costs. DiMOS helps restaurant owners to reduce the workload
          of their staff and minimize order errors by automating the
          order-taking process. This eliminates the need for servers to manually
          write down orders and reduces the likelihood of misheard,
          misunderstood, or lost orders.
        </p>

        <div class="section-image image">
          <img
            src="/assets/images/dimos/iphone14-dimos.webp"
            alt="DiMOS on iPad Mini "
            width="3000"
            height="2250"
          />
        </div>

        <p>
          The increased efficiency of the ordering process, facilitated by the
          app, enables customers to place orders directly from their table,
          reducing the amount of time servers spend walking back and forth
          between tables. As a result, restaurants can serve more guests in less
          time, leading to increased revenue. A well designed and user-friendly
          web application can enhance the customer experience and satisfaction.
          DiMOS provides a great customer experience, that can lead to increased
          customer loyalty and positive word-of-mouth marketing. DiMOS requires
          only a wireless internet connection and a few touchscreen devices,
          such as an iPad, tablet, or smartphone, reducing equipment costs and
          the need for expensive point-of-sale systems or other equipment.
        </p>

        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>
          To create the Kitchen Display System and Digital Menu, a monolithic
          architecture was adopted with an MVC (Model-View-Controller) design
          pattern. This design approach helps ensure simplicity in development
          and deployment while structuring the application in a modular and
          organized manner.
        </p>

        <div class="section-image image">
          <img
            src="/assets/images/dimos/mvc.webp"
            alt="DiMOS - Model-View-Controller"
            width="1775"
            height="1574"
          />
          <div class="overlay">
            <div class="text">Model View Controller Approach</div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          The system's frontend was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with
          EJS as the templating engine for dynamic content. On the backend,
          Node.js and Express.js were chosen to develop a scalable and efficient
          web application.
        </p>

        <div class="section-image image">
          <img
            src="/assets/images/dimos/system-architecture.webp"
            alt="DiMOS - System Architecture"
            width="1467"
            height="997"
          />
          <div class="overlay">
            <div class="text">System Architecture</div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          Role-based access control was implemented to manage user roles,
          granting specific permissions based on the tasks they needed to
          perform. The integration of Socket.io facilitated real-time
          communication, enabling order status updates for both customers and
          kitchen staff. The project relied on MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-based
          database, to store data efficiently. Passwords were encrypted using
          Bcrypt.js to enhance data security.
        </p>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
          DiMOS successfully met its objectives. Customers can now browse the
          digital menu, select their desired meals, and place orders with ease.
          The kitchen staff can track orders and change orders' status using the
          Kitchen Display System view. The menu management feature allows
          kitchen staff to efficiently add, edit, or delete dishes. Real-time
          updates on order status can make a significant improvement in the
          order management process. Additionally, the data insights dashboard
          provides valuable information on popular items, sales trends, and
          customer preferences.
        </p>

            width="3000"
            height="2250"
          />
        </div>

        <p>
          User feedback during the first release was instrumental in making
          several improvements to the application. Merging the menu and cart
          pages, resolving issues with order details links, and enhancing button
          sizes in the kitchen staff's view improved usability.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          The Kitchen Display System and Digital Menu have revolutionized the
          order management process for small restaurants. By providing an
          affordable and efficient alternative to traditional systems, the
          project empowers restaurant owners to digitalize their businesses and
          increase accuracy, speed, and customer satisfaction. The seamless
          integration of user-friendly interfaces, real-time updates, and data
          insights make this system an invaluable asset for small restaurant
          businesses looking to enhance their operations. With continued
          improvements and scalability considerations, the project holds the
          potential to transform the restaurant industry and modernize the
          dining experience.
