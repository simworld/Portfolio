        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The aim the website is to provide essential information about the
          childcare facility The Butterfly - Crèche & Childcare located in
          Dublin (Ireland). The website showcases the facility, its services,
          and its education philosophy, to allow the parents to make informed
          decisions about their child’s care and education. The name has been
          chosen because butterflies are often associated with growth and
          beauty, starting as caterpillars and eventually transforming as
          colourful butterflies. This symbolism represent the crèche’s mission
          of caring an supporting children through their own development.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Background</h3>
        <p>
          The inspiration for the project arises from the need for parents to
          have easy access to accurate information when selecting childcare
          services. Recognizing this challenge, The Butterfly aims to bridge the
          information gap by developing a user-friendly website that provides
          comprehensive insights into its offerings.
        </p>

        <p>By creating an online platform, the crèche aspires to:</p>
        <ul class="butterfly-ul">
          <li>
            <span>Inform Parents</span>: Provide detailed information about
            services, facilities, and educational methods.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Showcase Facilities</span>: Visually display the crèche's
            environment through photos of different areas.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Convey Philosophy</span>: Explain the crèche's educational
            philosophy and commitment to children's growth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Build Trust</span>: Feature testimonials from parents to
            enhance credibility.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Ultimately, the project's goal is to empower parents with the
          information they need to make confident decisions about their child's
          care and education. The website's transparency and accessibility align
          with The Butterfly's mission to provide a nurturing and supportive
          environment for children's development.
        </p>

        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>
          The development of The Butterfly - Crèche & Childcare's website was
          undertaken using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the
          aid of the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) integrated development
          environment.
        </p>

        <div class="section-image image">
          <img
            src="../../assets/images/butterfly/iphone-butterfly.webp"
            alt="DiMOS - Model-View-Controller"
            width="3000"
            height="2250"
          />
        </div>

        <p>
          Within the VSCode environment, the development process was streamlined
          through the use of code editing and debugging tools, enhancing
          efficiency and accuracy.
        </p>

        <p>
          The logo of The Butterfly - Crèche & Childcare was created using an
          iPad and the Apple Pencil. The inception of this logo stems from the
          letter "B" of "butterfly," ingeniously transformed into a gracefully
          stylized butterfly emblem. This artistic endeavor harmoniously merges
          technology and creativity to encapsulate the essence of growth and
          transformation that The Butterfly crèche embodies.
        </p>
