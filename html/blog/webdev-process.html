          Building a website involves six stages, that require planning,
          execution and maintenance. Whether you are working on a large project
          within a team or a smaller website on your own, understanding these
          six essential stages is crucial to ensure the success of your project.
          The development lifecycle of a website typically involves six stages:
          planning, designing, development, testing, deployment, and
          maintenance. Each of these stages requires a specific set of skills
          and expertise.

        <p>
          In this article, we will take a closer look at each stage, so you can
          better understand the web development process from start to finish. In
          this stage, the objectives, requirements, and specifications of the
          website are defined. This may include identifying the target audience,
          selecting the technology to use, creating a project timeline, and
          determining the budget.
        </p>

        <div class="section-image image">
          <img
            src="/assets/images/article-two/plan.webp"
            alt="Planning phase "
          />
        </div>
        <h2>1 - Planning</h2>
        <p>
          It is important to determine the purpose and goals of the website. For
          example, a client wants to sell products online, or he/she wants a
          portfolio website to show projects and works. To make the website
          usable and appealing it is important to identify the target audience.
          This information helps to understand how to design the website, which
          content needs to be created, what functionalities the website needs to
          have. After the objectives and target audience have been identified,
          the next steps are to create a project timeline and determine the
          budget. Once all these steps are completed and the budget are
          determined, the plan will be presented to the client for approval
          <a href="#ref-two"> (Felke-Morris, 2019).</a>
        </p>

        <div class="section-image image">
          <img
            src="/assets/images/article-two/design.webp"
            alt="Design phase "
          />
        </div>

        <h2>2 – Design</h2>
        <p>
          Once the planning stage is completed, the website design can be
          created. This process includes developing flow chart, wireframes and
          mock-ups. The flow chart illustrates the structure and hierarchy of
          the website’s pages. Once all the pages of the websites are
          identified, it is possible to create the wireframes. Wireframes are
          just sketches of how the pages will be constructed. Low-fidelity
          wireframes can be just sketches created by hand using pen and paper.
          To communicate the visual design of the website, it is possible to use
          the mock-ups. Mock-ups are high-fidelity visual representations of
          what the website will be once it is complete, including images and the
          actual text.
        </p>

            alt="Development phase"
          />
        </div>

        <h2>3 - Development</h2>
        <p>
          In this stage, the website is built and developed using programming
          languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This stage involves
          creating the website's structure, layout, and functionality. The
          development phase can involve several tasks, from writing the code to
          setting up the server-side functionality. In some cases, the website
          can be coded from scratch or the developers can speed up the work
          using frameworks or other tools like Bootstrap or Foundation
          <a href="#ref-one">(Chawre, 2022).</a>

        <div class="section-image image">
          <img
            src="/assets/images/article-two/testing.webp"
            alt="Testing phase"
          />
        </div>

        <h2>4 - Testing</h2>
        <p>
          The website is thoroughly tested to ensure it is functional and
          user-friendly. This stage involves checking for any bugs or errors,
          testing the website's performance and usability, and making sure it is
          compatible with different browsers and devices. The testing phase is a
          crucial part of the development process and takes place both during
          and after the development.
        </p>

        <div class="section-image image">
          <img
            src="/assets/images/article-two/deploy.webp"
            alt="Deployment phase"
          />
        </div>

        <h2>5 – Deployment</h2>
        <p>
          Once the website has been thoroughly tested, it is ready to be
          published. This stage involves uploading the website files to a web
          server and making it publicly available. To deploy a website, it is
          fundamental to have a registered domain name which is the website
          unique web address on the internet. A web hosting plan is also
          required to store the files and databases and make them available to
          the users on the internet. Additionally, security certificate such as
          SSL/TLS may need to be configured to ensure a secure communication
          between the user and the website.

            alt="Maintenance phase"
          />
        </div>

        <h2>6 - Maintenance</h2>
        <p>
          After the website has been launched, it requires ongoing maintenance
          to ensure it continues to function optimally. This may include
          updating the website's software, fixing bugs or errors, and adding new
          features or functionality.
