        <h2>The importance of the online presence</h2>
        <p>
          Nowadays it is essential for a company or a professional to have a
          website. In this digital world if a company does not have a strong
          online presence, they can miss a lot of opportunities
          <a href="#ref-four">(Your Virtual People, 2021)</a>. A website not
          only can improve the visibility for the company, but it can increase
          the revenue offering new ways of monetisation (for example online
          selling) and can expand the market share reaching more customers all
          over the world <a href="#ref-three">(Parachute, 2023)</a>. As shown by
          the picture below, time spent on the internet has increased by 12%
          over the last four years <a href="#ref-one">(Comscore, 2023)</a>.

        </div>

        <p>
          As discussed in an article by McCormick, one of the main points to try
          increase the online presence is to get a modern and attractive website
          <a href="#ref-two">(McCormick, 2021)</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>The four different ways to build a Website</h2>
        <p>
          In the early days of the internet, creating a website required
          technical knowledge of HTML. However, nowadays there are numerous
          methods for building a website, and even if you are not a web
          developer you can build your own website. There are four main ways to
          create a website: hand coding, using a website builder, using a
          component-based website, and using a framework. Each methods have its
          own benefits and drawbacks.
        </p>

        <h3>Hand Coding</h3>
        <p>
          Hand Coding is the traditional way to create a website. You create the
          mock-ups, write the code, and develop both front end and back end. To
          do that, you need to know some programming language and it takes more
          time to develop a website. Some pros are that you have full control of
          what you are doing, creating your own template, adding some features
          and more so you can personalise your product. However it is more
          complex specially if you are developing a big project which takes
          several hours of debugging and testing.
        </p>

        <div class="section-image image">
          <img
            src="/assets/images/article-one/handcoding.webp"
            alt="Hand Coding "
          />
        </div>

        <h3>Website Builder</h3>
        <p>
          A website builder is a tool that allows you to build and manage a
          website in an easy way. Unlike the hand coding approach, you do not
          need to have professional programming skills. You can use templates
          and themes that are already created and suit your business website. It
          is convenient compared to hand coding, and you do need to spend time
          on debugging and testing as the code is already written and tested.
          You can customise your website but usually you have some restrictions.
          Most of the available templates are similar, so when the website is
          done you can have a product that looks like other websites. An example
          of website builder is a Content Management System (CMS), like Wix or
          WordPress.
        </p>

        <div class="section-image image">
          <img
            src="/assets/images/article-one/builder.jpg"
            alt="Website Builder "
          />
        </div>

        <h3>Component-based website</h3>
        <p>
          The component-based approach uses pre-built components that when
          assembled together create a website. This approach allows the
          developers to create the website using reusable components that are
          easier to maintain and update. This method requires some technical
          skills and the knowledge of programming languages.
        </p>

        <div class="section-image image">
          <img
            src="/assets/images/article-one/component.webp"
            alt="Component-based website"
          />
        </div>

        <h3>Frameworks</h3>
        <p>
          A JavaScript framework or library like React.js or VUE.js, contains
          code with features and functions that can be integrated on the
          website. This approach offers a balance between hand coding and
          website builders, as the developer can speed up the development
          process using pre-built components.
        </p>

        <div class="section-image image">
          <img
            src="/assets/images/article-one/framework.webp"
            alt="Frameworks"
          />
        </div>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          In conclusion, website builder, hand coding, component-based, and
          JavaScript frameworks all have their own unique strengths and
          weaknesses. While some developers prefer the ease and convenience of
          website builder platforms, others enjoy the flexibility and control of
          hand coding, and still, others appreciate the power and efficiency of
          JavaScript frameworks. Ultimately, the choice between these different
          approaches to web development depends on your individual needs and
          preferences, as well as the specific requirements of each project. By
          experimenting with different tools and techniques, you can find the
          approach that works best for you and your projects. Whether you choose
          to work with a website builder, a component-based approach, hand code
          your sites, or use a JavaScript framework, remember to stay up to date
          with the latest trends and technologies in web development.
